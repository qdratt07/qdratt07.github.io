      <p>As a country boy from Texas, Quincy grew up as an only child with aunts and uncles like his brothers and sisters. When he was a kid, he enjoyed riding bikes, playing video games, and playing football. Raised in a household where the football team of choice was the <a href="https://www.dallascowboys.com/" target="_new">Dallas Cowboys</a>, he automatically became a fan of the team. As an adult, riding his <a href="https://www.harley-davidson.com/" target="_new">Harley Davidson</a> motorcycle, playing on computers, and <a href="https://prxperformance.com/" target="_new">weightlifting</a> are what he enjoyed most. It is easy to see that he enjoys what he liked as a kid but with adult upgrades.</p>
      <p>As a retired military member in the Navy, Quincy traveled the world as an Aviation Electrician who serviced both helicopters and jets.
