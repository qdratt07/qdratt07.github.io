			<p>As a country boy from Texas, Quincy grew up as an only child with aunts and uncles like his brothers and sisters. When he was a kid, he enjoyed riding bikes, playing video games, and playing football. Raised in a household 
				where the football team of choice was the <a href="https://www.dallascowboys.com/" target="_new">Dallas Cowboys</a>, he automatically became a fan of the team. As an adult, riding his <a href="https://www.harley-davidson.com/" target="_new">Harley Davidson</a> motorcycle, playing on computers, and <a href="https://prxperformance.com/" target="_new">weightlifting</a> are what he enjoyed most. It is easy to see that
				he enjoys what he liked as a kid but with adult upgrades.</p>
			<p>As a retired military member in the Navy, Quincy traveled the world as an Aviation Electrician who serviced both helicopters and jets. At the end of his military career, he chose to work for the government as a Training Specialist at a submarine
				base in Virginia. After a couple of years living on the east coast, he relocated back to his home state of Texas. Continuing to work, heâ€™s now a Configurations Manager for an important role with the government. When not working, Quincy 
				enjoys being a homebody by watching television shows and movies. Every now and then you may see him and his wife experiencing the city's nightlife.</p>
